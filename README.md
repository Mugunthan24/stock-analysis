# stock-analysis
Performing analysis on green energy stocks to determine total daily volume and yearly return.
## Overview of Project
Steve just finished school with a finance degree. His parents have elected to be his first clients and are specifically interested in investing in DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ). Steve was a little worried and wanted to diversify his parents portfolio and while also doing research to determine if the DQ stock was a worthwhile investment. Steve has decided to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DQ. To make this analysis more efficient VBA will be used to automate the procedure.
## Results
The results will explain the performance of the stocks in 2017 and 2018 as well as the steps that were taken to make the code used to automate gathering the information for the analysis more Computationally efficient.
